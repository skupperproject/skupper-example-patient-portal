title: Patient Portal
subtitle: A simple database-backed web application that runs in the public cloud but keeps its data in a private database
github_actions_url: https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-example-patient-portal/actions/workflows/main.yaml
overview: |
  This example is a simple database-backed web application that shows
  how you can use Skupper to access a database at a remote site
  without exposing it to the public internet.

  It contains three services:

    * A PostgreSQL database running on a bare-metal or virtual
      machine in a private data center.

    * A payment-processing service running on Kubernetes in a private
      data center.

    * A web frontend service running on Kubernetes in the public
      cloud.  It uses the PostgreSQL database and the
      payment-processing service.

  This example uses two Kubernetes namespaces, "private" and "public",
  to represent the private Kubernetes cluster and the public cloud.

  - title: Deploy and expose the database
    preamble: |
      Use `docker` to run the database service on your local machine.
      In the public namespace, use the `skupper gateway expose`
      command to expose the database on the Skupper network.

      Use `kubectl get service/database` to ensure the database
      service is available.
    commands:
      public:
        - run: docker run --name patient-portal-database --detach --rm -p 5432:5432 quay.io/skupper/patient-portal-database
        - run: skupper gateway expose database localhost 5432 --type docker

  - title: Deploy and expose the payment processor
    preamble: |
      In the private namespace, use the `kubectl apply` command to
      deploy the payment processor service.  Use the `skupper expose`
      command to expose the service on the Skupper network.

      In the public namespace, use `kubectl get service/payment-processor` to
      check that the `payment-processor` service appears after a
      moment.
    commands:
      private:
        - run: kubectl apply -f payment-processor/kubernetes.yaml
          output: deployment.apps/payment-processor created
        - await: deployment/payment-processor
        - run: skupper expose deployment/payment-processor --port 8080
          output: deployment payment-processor exposed as payment-processor
      public:
        - await: service/payment-processor
        - run: kubectl get service/payment-processor
          output: |
            NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
            payment-processor   ClusterIP   10.103.227.109   <none>        8080/TCP   1s
  - title: Deploy and expose the frontend
    preamble: |
      In the public namespace, use the `kubectl apply` command to
      deploy the frontend service.  This also sets up an external load
      balancer for the frontend.
    commands:
      public:
        - run: kubectl apply -f frontend/kubernetes.yaml
          output: |
            deployment.apps/frontend created
            service/frontend created
        - await: [deployment/frontend, service/frontend]

        - run: skupper gateway delete
        - run: skupper delete
        - run: kubectl delete service/frontend
        - run: kubectl delete deployment/frontend
